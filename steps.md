# Building a Multi-User LLM Chat Application with WebSockets

## **Introduction**

In this guide, we will walk you through creating a multi-user chat application that allows multiple users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) in real-time using WebSockets. This app will consist of a web-based frontend for users and a Go backend that handles WebSocket connections and LLM integration.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the Goal**

We aim to create a web-based application where:

1. **Multiple users** can connect simultaneously.
2. Each user can **send prompts** (questions or statements) to an LLM.
3. The LLM will generate a **response** and send it back to each specific user.
4. **WebSockets** will ensure real-time communication between the users and the server.

---

## **Step 2: System Architecture**

### 1. **Frontend (Web Interface)**

- The user interface where users can type their questions and see responses from the LLM.
- It will run in a web browser and maintain a persistent connection to the backend using WebSockets.
- Components:
  - Text box for typing prompts.
  - Display area for chat history.
  - "Send" button.

### 2. **Backend (Go Server)**

- Manages WebSocket connections for all users.
- Receives user prompts, forwards them to the LLM, and returns responses to the specific user.
- Tracks active WebSocket connections and ensures the response is sent to the correct user.

### 3. **LLM Integration**

- The LLM is the brain of the app. It can be either:
  - A **cloud-based LLM** (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT API).
  - A **local LLM** running on your server (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-J).
- The server sends user prompts to the LLM and returns the responses to the client.

## **Step 3: Setting Up the Project**

### Project Structure

```
/llm-chat-app
  ├── main.go            # The Go server that manages WebSockets and LLM interaction
  ├── llm.go             # LLM integration logic (handles API calls to the LLM)
  └── public             # Frontend files
      ├── index.html     # User interface (chat window)
      ├── script.js      # Handles WebSocket connection and user interaction
      └── styles.css     # Optional styling for the chat interface
```

---

## **Step 4: Building the WebSocket Server**

The server will:

1. **Upgrade HTTP connections to WebSocket connections** for real-time communication.
2. **Handle multiple simultaneous connections** from users.
3. **Receive user messages (prompts)** and forward them to the LLM.
4. **Send the LLM’s response** back to the user.

When a user connects:

- The server will add their connection to a list of active connections.
- When they send a message, the server will pass it to the LLM.
- After receiving a response from the LLM, the server will send the response back through the same WebSocket connection.

---

## **Step 5: Handling Multiple Users**

In a multi-user system:

- **Each user has their own WebSocket connection**.
- The server needs to know which response belongs to which user.
- This is done by **tracking connections** in a data structure (like a map of user IDs to WebSocket connections).

The server can either:

1. **Send responses only to the user who asked the question**.
2. **Broadcast the response to all connected users** (useful for shared discussions).

---

## **Step 6: Integrating the LLM**

- The server interacts with the LLM to get responses.
- If you’re using a cloud-based LLM like OpenAI’s GPT:
  - The server sends the user’s prompt to the GPT API.
  - The GPT API returns a response, which the server sends back to the client.
- If you’re running a local LLM:
  - The server calls a function that generates responses from the local model.

---

## **Step 7: Building the Frontend (User Interface)**

The frontend will:

1. **Connect to the WebSocket server** when the page loads.
2. **Allow the user to type a message** and send it to the server.
3. **Display the LLM’s response** in the chat window.

### Key Frontend Elements:

- **Text input**: For the user to type their message.
- **Chat display**: Shows the conversation history (both user messages and LLM responses).
- **WebSocket connection**: Continuously listens for incoming responses from the server.

---

## **Step 8: Deploying the App**

### 1. **Local Testing**

- Test everything on your local machine.
- Use **localhost:8080** for the WebSocket server and open the `index.html` file in a browser.

### 2. **Scaling and Deployment**

- Deploy the server on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku).
- Use **Nginx** or another reverse proxy to manage WebSocket connections at scale.
- For security, consider adding **authentication and HTTPS**.

---

## **Step 9: Enhancing the App**

- **Add user authentication** so each user has their own account.
- **Track conversations** in a database (e.g., store prompts and responses for each user).
- **Improve LLM response times** by caching common responses.
- **Optimize for mobile** so users can interact with the LLM on any device.

## **Example User Journey**

1. User opens the web app and sees a chat window.
2. The user types a question, like: *"What is the capital of France?"*
3. The frontend sends this prompt to the Go server via WebSocket.
4. The Go server forwards the prompt to the LLM.
5. The LLM responds with *"The capital of France is Paris."*
6. The Go server sends this response back to the user’s browser.
7. The user sees the response in real time in the chat window.

## **Next Steps**

1. Build the WebSocket server.
2. Create the frontend interface.
3. Integrate the LLM.
4. Test the system and deploy it.
